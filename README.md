# Learn Develop and Grow Web App

This repository contains the frontend code for a web application built with React.js, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. The web app is designed for a startup that sells courses on personality development. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for potential customers to browse and purchase the available courses.

## Features

- Course Listings: Browse through a catalog of personality development courses with detailed information about each course, including the course title, description, instructor, duration, and price.
- Course Details: View additional details about a specific course, such as the course syllabus, prerequisites, and any special offers or discounts.
- User Authentication: Allow users to create accounts, log in, and log out. This enables users to save their preferences, track their course progress, and access exclusive content.
- Responsive Design: Ensuring the web app is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience for users on desktop, tablets, and smartphones.
- Embedded Google maps: Ensuring that the users can easily find the address to the coaching center.

## Tools Used

The frontend of the Learn Develop and Grow Web App has been developed using the following tools and technologies:

- **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js provides a component-based approach to development, making it easy to create reusable UI components and manage application state efficiently.

- **JavaScript**: The programming language used to implement the logic and functionality of the web app. JavaScript is a versatile language that runs in the browser and allows for dynamic and interactive elements in web applications.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined classes to rapidly build responsive and customizable user interfaces. Tailwind CSS offers a highly flexible and intuitive approach to styling, allowing developers to create unique designs without writing custom CSS.

- **Create React App**: A popular toolchain for creating React.js applications with no configuration. Create React App provides a development environment that includes useful features such as hot module replacement, linting, and optimized production builds.

- **Vercel**: A cloud platform for static site hosting and serverless functions. Vercel simplifies the deployment process by providing seamless integration with version control systems and automatic builds and deployments. It offers a user-friendly interface and supports custom domains, making it an excellent choice for hosting the web app.

These tools and technologies were carefully selected to ensure efficient development, robust user interfaces, and smooth user experiences throughout the Learn Develop and Grow Web App.
